spring-boot-starter-maintenance is a maintenance mode library and auto-configuration for spring boot web and security projects.

With spring-boot-starter-maintenance anyone can easily use best practices during maintenance work on their applications. In fact, every HTTP client will receive a response with status code 503 - Service Unavailable during maintenance. This library provides injection points for alert- and clean-up tasks and detailed metrics. Everything is customizable and extendable programmed.

### Requirements

JDK >= 1.8

spring-boot-starter-maintenance depends on the following two dependencies and will not start without them present.

- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web *(required)*
- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security *(required)*
- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa *(optional, needed only if you enable metrics)*

### Download

Gradle:
```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.viascom.devutils:spring-boot-starter-maintenance:0.0.2'
}
```

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.viascom.devutils</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-maintenance</artifactId>

</dependency>
```

[spring-boot-starter-maintenance jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.viascom.devutils/spring-boot-starter-maintenance) are available from Maven Central.

### Getting Started

Open your implementation of the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (f.e. named WebSecurityConfig) and add the following three parts:

**Step 1:** Autowire maintenance
```java
@Autowired
private Maintenance maintenance;
```

**Step 2:** Add a request matcher
```java
.authorizeRequests()
.requestMatchers(new DefaultMaintenanceRequestMatcher(maintenance)).denyAll()
```

**Step 3:** Add a access denie handler
```java
.exceptionHandling()
.accessDeniedHandler(new DefaultMaintenanceAccessDeniedHandler(maintenance))
```
