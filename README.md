# spring-boot-starter-maintenance ![Build Status](https://github.com/viascom/spring-boot-starter-maintenance/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

spring-boot-starter-maintenance is a maintenance mode library and auto-configuration for spring boot web and security projects.

With spring-boot-starter-maintenance anyone can easily enforce best practices during maintenance work on their applications. For example, every HTTP client will receive a response with status code 503 - Service Unavailable during maintenance. On top of that, the library provides an injection point for clean-up tasks and detailed statistics. Everything is customizable and extendable programmed in mind.
