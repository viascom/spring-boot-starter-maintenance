**spring-boot-starter-maintenance** is an extensible auto-configuration library for spring boot web and security
projects supporting Java and Kotlin applications to block access to your application during maintenances and still
provide a secure open door for your maintainers.

With spring-boot-starter-maintenance anyone can easily make use of best practices during maintenance work on their
applications. In fact, every HTTP client will receive a response with status code 503 - Service Unavailable during
maintenance. This library provides additionally injection points for alert- and clean-up tasks.

spring-boot-starter-maintenance is ready to use out of the box for most common setups. Even for uncommon applications
and technologies, it should be simple to implement the necessary interfaces to connect a library/framework/etc. to it.

## Requirements

JDK >= 1.8

spring-boot-starter-maintenance depends on the following two dependencies and will not start without them present.

- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web *(required)*
- org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security *(required)*

## Download

Gradle:

```gradle
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.viascom.devutils:spring-boot-starter-maintenance:0.0.1'
}
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.viascom.devutils</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-maintenance</artifactId>

</dependency>
```

[spring-boot-starter-maintenance jar downloads](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.viascom.devutils/spring-boot-starter-maintenance)
are available from Maven Central.

## Getting Started

Open your implementation of the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter (f.e. named WebSecurityConfig) and add the following three
parts:

**Step 1:** Autowire maintenance

```java
@Autowired
private Maintenance maintenance;
```

**Step 2:** Add a request matcher

```java
.authorizeRequests()
.requestMatchers(new DefaultMaintenanceRequestMatcher(maintenance)).denyAll()
```

**Step 3:** Add a access denie handler

```java
.exceptionHandling()
.accessDeniedHandler(new DefaultMaintenanceAccessDeniedHandler(maintenance))
```

## Configuration Properties

### Basic configuration example

```yaml
maintenance:
  enabled: true
  roles:
    - ADMIN
```

### Full configuration example

```yaml
maintenance:
  enabled: true
  roles:
    - MAINTAINER
    - ADMIN
  alert: true
  clean: true
  retry-after: 30
  events: true
```
